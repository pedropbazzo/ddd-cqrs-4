# cqrs4j-example-aggregates
DDD related code for all demo applications (aggregates, entities and business exceptions).

> :warning: Normally you should **not** share code this way between your command microservices. A *shared-nothing* approach is a good practice for microservices (See for example [Don't Share Libraries among Microservices](https://phauer.com/2016/dont-share-libraries-among-microservices/)). You can simply copy the content of this module directly into your command project.
