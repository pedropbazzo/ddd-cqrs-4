# cqrs4j-spring-example-shared
Code shared between Spring Boot command and query microservice.

> :warning: Normally you should **not** share code this way between your command and query microservices. A shared-nothing approach is a good practice for microservices (See for example [Don't Share Libraries among Microservices](https://phauer.com/2016/dont-share-libraries-among-microservices/)). You can simply copy the content of this module directly into your command and query projects.
